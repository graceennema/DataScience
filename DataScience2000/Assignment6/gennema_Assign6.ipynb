One of the big difference in posterior probability is that it takes into account an initial level of belief, whereas p-value is a statement about the probability of observing particular data."

    "This is not the conclusion I would draw from the data. The 0.4 difference that is being claimed comes purely from the difference in mean weight values (7.1882 and 6.7166), not from actual statistical evidence. The results of the two tailed test showed that there was not enough statistical evidence to reject the null hypothesis that there is no difference. The bayes factor however is within the 3-20 threshold meaning there is positive evidence for it, but it is still not very strong. The posterior probabily would also suggest there is less than 70% chance that smoking reduces birth weigth by 0.5lbs. The various tests performed provides conflicting ideas of the actual results that can be drawn, as a result of this I would say the evidence is not strong enough for any claim to be made based on this data."
