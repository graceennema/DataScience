(99/100) Q1.4 (-1): there is a tiny mistake in your code. The inputs to the confidenceInt are missing ","s. inputs should be d[:, 1] and d[:, 2]. To spot the difference, print d[:, 1] and d[:1]. Q1.6 (-1): same mistake as in Q1.4. Remember that d is a two dimensional array and you will need two values to index it Very well done! your attention to the details and your written answers are great! So I will give you 99 instead of 98:)
